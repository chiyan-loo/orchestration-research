third full-length album released by Seattle progressive metal band Nevermore, and was released through Century Media in 1999.\\', \\' Unlike its predecessor, \"The Politics of Ecstasy\", this album is very emotional and contains many slower, ballad-type songs.\\', \\' It is also notable that \"Dreaming Neon Black\" is a concept album of sorts.\\', \\' According to Nevermore\\\\\\'s lead singer, Warrel Dane, \"it\\\\\\'s a very simple story about a man who slowly goes insane after losing a woman that he was very close to.\\', \\' Progressive levels of insanity are expressed in the songs, he

all happy.\"\\', \\', which may be based on an event in the life of Dane.\\', \\' Supposedly, his old girlfriend left him when she joined a religious cult and was never heard from again, and he began having nightmares of her crying out to him as she drowned.\\', \\' This has been confirmed by Warrel himself in an older interview.\\', \\' The spoken word samples from the tracks \"Ophidian\" and

record stores.\\', \\' Because of contractual problems with Epic Records, the full version was never released for public consumption.\\', \\' Epic Records destroyed 500+ copies of this CD.\\', \\' Warrel Dane has stated on several occasions that he has the master tapes and copyrights of the full show and intended to have it finally released.\\', \\' To date that has not happened.\\', \\' This

         "1. CONTEXT-QUERY INTERACTION: The query requires extracting the birth date of an American stunt performer mentioned in the context who is associated with the Stunt Cycle. This involves identifying the correct individual and retrieving their birth date. There's a potential for ambiguity if multiple stunt performers are mentioned, necessitating careful selection. The presence of 'Stunt Cycle' indicates a specific filter to apply. The context is relatively short, but requires careful parsing to extract the correct information. Overall, this is a moderately complex information retrieval task. 2. MULTI-AGENT JUSTIFICATION: Using multiple agents allows for independent verification and cross-referencing of information. A predictor agent can identify relevant individuals within the context, while a second predictor agent focuses specifically on the Stunt Cycle connection. A third predictor agent can extract the birth date. This multi-faceted approach enhances accuracy. 3. SUMMARIZER OR NOT? NO: The context is short and doesn't contain irrelevant information. 4. PREDICTOR OR DEBATER OR BOTH? PREDICTOR: The task involves information extraction and factual lookups, which are best handled by predictor agents. 5. AGGREGATOR: Since multiple predictor agents are used in the middle phase, an aggregator is necessary to synthesize their outputs and provide a consolidated answer. 6. REFINER OR NOT? YES: Due to the need for accurate information retrieval and the potential for errors in entity disambiguation and date extraction, a refiner is used to verify the final answer and improve its quality.
